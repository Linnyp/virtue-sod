              Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum) is a warm-season grass that is
              well-suited for tropical and subtropical regions, including
              Southwest Florida. It is known for its coarse texture, deep-green
              color, and durability. Bahia grass is popular for lawns, pastures,
              and roadside applications due to its ability to thrive in various
              soil types and its tolerance for drought and heat.

                    <p>
                      Zoysia grass has a fine texture, creating a soft and
                      attractive lawn surface. It's often appreciated for its
                      aesthetic appeal.

                      CitraBlue is described as having a blue-green color,

                    <p>
                      While some may consider this a pro, Zoysia grass tends to
                      have slower growth compared to other warm-season grasses,
                      resulting in less frequent mowing requirements.

                    <h2>- Shade Sensitivity:</h2>
                    <p>
                      While Zoysia grass can tolerate some shade, it generally
                      prefers full sun. In shaded areas, it may thin out and
                      struggle to thrive.

                    <p>
                      Zoysia sod can be more expensive than some other grass
                      varieties, which may impact the initial cost of
                      establishing a lawn.

                      Some regions may have limited availability of certain
                      Zoysia grass varieties, and not all varieties may perform
                      equally well in Southwest Florida.
